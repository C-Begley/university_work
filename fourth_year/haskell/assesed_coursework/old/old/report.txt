For this report, I am comparing my experiences with Haskell and
Python.  In particular, I have used the Scalpel scraping library in
Haskell, and the equivalent scrapy library in Python.

Code size: Functional code in general (and Haskell in particular) is
  highly concise. This comes from powerful features like higher order
  functions on lists- much more concise than for/while loop
  control-flow structures in Python. Also, high-level operators and
  functions are provided in the standard libraries (like Data.List).


Code readability: While Haskell code is particularly dense, it can be
  difficult to read sometimes. Meaningful variable names might help.


Code maintainability:
  Bug fixes? Comments?


Toolchain support: Does stack work as well as pip? Is there as much
  online support for Haskell as for Python? Does this affect developer
  productivity at all?


Write  a  short  (500  word  max)  report,  as  a  plaintext  file  called  report.txt.   In  this  document,  you  shouldsummarize your experiences of developing this project code in Haskell.  How is it similar to more mainstreamlanguages  like  Python  or  Java?   How  is  it  different?   Are  there  any  Haskell-specific  features  you  really  like?Why?  Are there any features you intensely dislike?  Why?
