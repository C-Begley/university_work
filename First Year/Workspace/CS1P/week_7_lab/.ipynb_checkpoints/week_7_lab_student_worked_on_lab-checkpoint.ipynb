    "* **Use**. We should be able to use objects on other objects with a new **use** action.\n",

    "### Use\n",
    "We might make the `guard_angry` flag become True if you **use** a `cudgel` on the `guard`. You need to add a new **use** command. **use** needs to take **one** or **two** nouns so you can write things like:\n",

    "          }\n",
    "          \n",
    "The functions should change the world state and print a message describing what has happened. You should also add functionality so that entering or leaving a room can change the world state by calling a function.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Fixed objects\n",
    "To solve the last problem, create a dictionary that stores object properties like their \"fixedness\". Then look up the object in the dictionary whenever the user tries to **take** something.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task\n",
    "Implement these changes, and **adjust the game world to use them.**\n",
    "\n",
    "You should be able to create a world where actions have persistent effects; the flags should for example change the effect of actions, or change the description of rooms.  Opening a window in a room might change the description of light entering it.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also want to alter the exits available from rooms as a function of the world state; for example, flipping a lever might raise a drawbridge and cut off a possible exit (or lower it and create a new one.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, consider allowing objects to appear when other objects are examined (\"examine binoculars\" -> \"you find a nifty lens!\" -> \"take lens\"). Again, use a dictionary to represent this.\n"
